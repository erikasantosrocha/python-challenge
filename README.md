Python Challenge

PyBank

The Python script analyzes the financial records of a company. The financial dataset provided is budget_data.csv and is composed of two columns corresponding to Date and Profit/Losses.

The script analyses the records and calculates each of the following values:

    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

At the end, the script prints the Financial Analysis Summary in the terminal and exports the results as a text file, which is stored in the "analysis" folder.


PyPoll

The Python script analyzes the results of a poll data for a rural town election. The data set provided is election_data.csv and this dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

The script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

    - The total number of votes cast
    - A complete list of candidates who received votes
    - The percentage of votes each candidate won
    - The total number of votes each candidate won
    - The winner of the election based on popular vote

At the end, the script prints the Election Results Summary in the terminal and exports the results as a text file, which is stored in the "analysis" folder.
